# [Shop Dogg](https://zzanetti.github.io/ShopDogg/)

This repository contains all the files needed to host the website for a small business. 
The website has the following features:
* Overview of Company Products, Services, and About Us
* Individual Product Pages
* A functional Contact Me page refactored from the Bootstrap template

## Getting Started

To access the site use the following link: https://zzanetti.github.io/ShopDogg/

## Coming Soon...

Currently working on adding responsiveness to product selection in terms of image display for the wine rack. User should select a size and only see images for that size.

Also working on integrating a freedb for which items are in stock, and create a generic product page that boots all info from the db, i.e. name, description, options, photos.

## Creator

This website was created by Zach Zanetti as a strictly for fun project for a friend. It was built using a template directly from Bootstrap with some added HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery, and JS.
